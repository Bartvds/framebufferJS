# lorez

Bitmap rendering system for low-res pixel games.

The canvas rendering is specialised for up-scaling with 100% crispy pixels and in modern browsers the optional WebGL renderer can easily run at 60 frames-per-second in HD resolution. 

lorez is especially suited for 32x32 pixel micro games on large screens.

## Development

The project is written in JavaScript using CommonJS module pattern, and build for browsers using [grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify). Development tools run on [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and are pulled from [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/).

The generated bundles support UMD and work as browser global, CommonJS and AMD module. Browserify users can also use the npm package directly.

To regenerate the bundles use the following steps:

1) Clone the git repos to you local machine.

2) Make sure you have the global grunt command:

````bash
$ npm install grunt-cli -g
```` 

3) Navigate your shell/terminal to the checkout directory.

4) Install development dependencies from npm:

````bash
$ npm install
````

5) Rebuild bundles using grunt:

````bash
$ grunt build
````

6) Watch tasks to auto-build during development:

````bash
$ grunt watch
````

7) Run a local test server for the demos and tests:

````bash
$ grunt server
````

See the `Gruntfile.js` and `$ grunt --help` for additional commands.
